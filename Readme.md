# Important Update Regarding My GitHub Account

Hello, everyone!

Due to an unfortunate incident, my original GitHub account was **hacked**. During the period when I had lost access, I created a temporary account to continue working on my projects and share updates. Thankfully, I have now **regained access** to my original account!

## Why This Repository?
This repository has been created to clarify any confusion regarding my GitHub presence. Many of my links on social media still point to this temporary account, and updating all of them would be impractical. Therefore, I'm using this space to redirect you to my main GitHub profile.

## My Main GitHub Account
You can view all my active repositories and ongoing projects here:

I appreciate your understanding and support. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to reach out.

Thank you for your time and patience!
